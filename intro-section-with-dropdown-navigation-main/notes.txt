difference bw before:: and after::

adding before and after does not mean you are applying the psuedo class on top or beneath the content, but it means
you are adding that class before and after the actuall content. (it is just like adding a div before or after the content of a class)

before and after does not apply to img cuz the dont really have an actual content except the image itself which is essentially not content.
